Workflow:
1. Open Github Trending, HN Top News, Show_HN, new research papers launch sites, 3x times a day, fetch the data and identify most relevant items to my interests.
* use Github actions for cron,
* use MCP servers for collecting and extracting data?
* create "knowledge" section to store my taste and preferences as "memory" to better identify items relevant to me.
